# Similar-Player-Detector

Talent detector helps you find football talents thanks to outlier detection algorithms

This app makes use of [FIFA video game](https://sofifa.com) KPIs to search for similar players to a given one. It employs pre-defind conditions such as league, age, market value, and wage combining with [Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah)](https://github.com/spotify/annoy) to search for points in space that are close to a given query point.
